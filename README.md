## Credit Score Model
This project basically classifies the user through a score based on selected characteristics that brings powerful insights into who wants Credit. To obtain this credit score we need to use some Machine Learning techniques, so let's try to understand the steps below.

## First we understand our data, to process this data

For example, here we are eliminating the unnecessary column.

And here we are eliminating these outliers.

## Thirdly, let's try to validate the correlation between the features and the score
